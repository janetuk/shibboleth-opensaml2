opensaml2 (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * Bump SONAME of libsaml following upstream's versioning.  The names of
    libsaml2-dev and libsaml2-doc have not changed; the "2" in those names
    refers to the major version of the package, not to the SONAME of the
    library.
  * Build-depend on libxmtooling-dev >= 1.1 following the upstream spec
    file.
  * Flesh out debian/copyright with entries for build system files and
    convert to the latest draft of the copyright format proposal.
  * Remove duplicated Section header in the libsaml3 control stanza.

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Fix watch file for upstream directory structure.
