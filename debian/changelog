opensaml2 (2.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency set to high for security fix.
  * New upstream release.
    - SECURITY: Partial fix for improper handling of URLs that could be
      abused for script injection and other cross-site scripting attacks.
      The complete fix also requires newer xmltooling and shibboleth-sp2
      packages.  (CVE-2009-3300)
    - Fix crash on assertions with missing SubjectConfirmation.
    - Remove inline functions except for templates or RAII patterns.
    - Remove xml from the inclusive prefix list to avoid bugs in Apache
      Java xmlsec.
    - Honor digest algorithm in whole document signing with empty URI.
  * Rename library package for upstream SONAME bump.
  * Build-depend on libxmltooling-dev 1.3 or later and make libsaml2-dev
    depend on libxmltooling-dev 1.3 or later for the fixes for URL
    sanitization.
  * Build-depend on libxml-security-c-dev 1.5 or later to ensure
    that all builds are consistent.

opensaml2 (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * Bump SONAME of libsaml following upstream's versioning.  The names of
    libsaml2-dev and libsaml2-doc have not changed; the "2" in those names
    refers to the major version of the package, not to the SONAME of the
    library.
  * Build-depend on libxmtooling-dev >= 1.1 following the upstream spec
    file.
  * Flesh out debian/copyright with entries for build system files and
    convert to the latest draft of the copyright format proposal.
  * Remove duplicated Section header in the libsaml3 control stanza.

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Fix watch file for upstream directory structure.
