opensaml2 (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Don't download remote metadata if it hasn't changed
    - Verify that fetched metadata is valid, even after filters, before
      overwriting the previous metadata.  Improve metadata downloads.
    - Logging improvements for OpenSAML.MetadataProvider.XML
    - Add keywords/tags element to UIInfo extension and disco feed
    - Fix overuse of InclusivePrefixes list when signing
    - Do not use cacheDuration for validity
    - Fix memory leaks
    - Fix crash when encrypting unmarshalled object
    - Resolve sibling EncryptedKey element for decryption
    - Add xml prefix on newly-created xml:lang attributes
    - Duplication and line feed fixes for DiscoFeed.
    - Fix reload interval backoff after reload failures
    - Strip whitespace from SAMLRequest URL parameter values
  * Change package names for the upstream SONAME change.
  * Install the new upstream pkg-config file in libsaml2-dev.
  * Build-depend on xmltooling 1.4 or later.
  * Force build dependency on xml-security-c 1.6 or later for consistent
    build results.
  * Add build dependency on pkg-config, which upstream now uses to find
    the SSL libraries.
  * Add build dependency on graphviz for better API documentation.
  * Replace the version of jQuery installed by Doxygen in the
    documentation package with a symlink to the version supplied by the
    Debian package and add a dependency.
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level V8.
    - Use the autotools-dev debhelper module for config.{sub,guess}.
    - Use debhelper rule minimization.
  * Update debian/copyright to the current DEP-5 specification.
  * Change to Debian source format 3.0 (quilt).  Force a single Debian
    patch for simplicity since the packaging is maintained in Git using
    branches, and include a patch header explaining why.
  * Update standards version to 3.9.1 (no changes required).

      packages.  (CVE-2009-3300)
    - Fix crash on assertions with missing SubjectConfirmation.
    - Remove inline functions except for templates or RAII patterns.

      Java xmlsec.
    - Honor digest algorithm in whole document signing with empty URI.
  * Rename library package for upstream SONAME bump.
  * Build-depend on libxmltooling-dev 1.3 or later and make libsaml2-dev
    depend on libxmltooling-dev 1.3 or later for the fixes for URL
    sanitization.
  * Build-depend on libxml-security-c-dev 1.5 or later to ensure
    that all builds are consistent.

opensaml2 (2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Russ Allbery ]
  * New upstream bug-fix release.
  * Bump SONAME of libsaml following upstream's versioning.  The names of
    libsaml2-dev and libsaml2-doc have not changed; the "2" in those names
    refers to the major version of the package, not to the SONAME of the
    library.
  * Build-depend on libxmtooling-dev >= 1.1 following the upstream spec
    file.
  * Flesh out debian/copyright with entries for build system files and
    convert to the latest draft of the copyright format proposal.
  * Remove duplicated Section header in the libsaml3 control stanza.

  [ Ferenc Wagner ]
  * Fix watch file for upstream directory structure.
